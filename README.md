 A super super simple ASP.net webapp that automates a "mundane task"

This is a public version of the app that I removed all my details from, I seriously doubt anybody will want to use this but me, it's hilariously overbuilt this really should be a CLI app because it's just string concatonation, but I figured since I was doing it in C# I would just make it a fullstack ASP.net app as well just to prove I can make webapps in .NET as well and have that on my portfolio.
